    "text": "Base 64 Encoding\n\n\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n\n\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n\n\n\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n\n\n... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with \n=\n to make the length a multiple of 4)\n\n\nThere's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs\n\n\nBase64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\n\n\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n\nBasic encoding/decoding\n\n\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\nConvert text to base64\n\n\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n\nConvert base64 back to text\n\n\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n\n\nConvert to URL-safe base64\n\n\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n\nWorking with binary files (e.g., images)\n\n\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n\nData URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\n\n\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\n```\n\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\n\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n\nhtml\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\n\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n\n\n\nJSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n\n\nEmail: MIME attachments encoding\n\n\nAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n\n\nJWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n\n\nSSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n\n\nSAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n\n\nGit: Encoding binary files in patches\n\n\n\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n\n\n\nBase64 Decoder/Encoder\n for online encoding/decoding\n\n\ndata: URI Generator\n converts files to Data URIs\n\n",

    "text": "Converting HTML to Markdown\n\n\nWhen working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:\n\n\n\n\nContent analysis\n: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\n\n\nData mining\n: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\n\n\nOffline reading\n: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\n\n\nContent migration\n: Move content between different CMS platforms\n\n\nSEO analysis\n: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\n\n\nArchive creation\n: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\n\n\nAccessibility\n: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.\n\n\ndefuddle-cli\n\n\ndefuddle-cli\n specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\n\nbash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\n\n\n\n\nfind . -name '*.html'\n: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n\n\n-exec ... \\;\n: Executes the following command for each file found\n\n\nnpx --package defuddle-cli -y\n: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\n\n\ndefuddle parse {} --md\n: Parses the HTML file (represented by \n{}\n) and converts to markdown\n\n\n-o {}.md\n: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\n\n\n\n\nPandoc\n\n\nPandoc\n is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\n\n\n\nbash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\n\n\n\n\nfind . -name '*.html'\n: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n\n\n-exec ... \\;\n: Executes the following command for each file found\n\n\npandoc\n: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n\n\n-f html -t markdown_strict\n: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n\n\n-o {}.md {}\n: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\n\n\n\n\nLynx\n\n\nLynx\n is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\n\nbash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\n\n\n\n\nfind . -type f -name '*.html'\n: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n\n\n-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +\n: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n\n\nfor f; do ... done\n: Loops through each file in the batch\n\n\nlynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"\n: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n\n\n-dump\n: Output the rendered page to stdout\n\n\n-nolist\n: Don't include the list of links at the end\n\n\n> \"${f%.html}.txt\"\n: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\n\n\n\n\nw3m\n\n\nw3m\n is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer",

    "text": "Converting PDFs to Markdown\n\n\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n\nUse Cases:\n\n\n\n\nLLM training and fine-tuning\n: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n\n\nKnowledge base creation\n: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n\n\nContent repurposing\n: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n\n\nData extraction\n: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n\n\nAccessibility\n: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n\n\nCitation and reference management\n: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n\n\nDocumentation conversion\n: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n\n\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM\n\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM\n is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses \nMuPDF\n as its PDF parsing engine. \nPyMuPDF\n is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\n\nbash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\n\n\n\n\nPYTHONUTF8=1\n: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n\n\nuv run --with pymupdf4llm\n: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n\n\npython -c '...'\n: Executes Python code directly from the command line\n\n\nimport pymupdf4llm\n: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n\n\nh = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")\n: Creates a file to write the markdown output\n\n\nh.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))\n: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n\n\n\nMarkitdown\n\n\n\n\nMarkitdown\n is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\n\nbash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\n\n\n\n\nPYTHONUTF8=1\n: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n\n\nuvx markitdown\n: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n\n\n$FILE.pdf\n: The input PDF file\n\n\n> markitdown.md\n: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n\n\n\nUnstructured\n\n\nUnstructured\n is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n\nGROBID\n\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, \nGROBID\n remains the de facto choice.

It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n\nAzure Document Intelligence API\n\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, \nAzure Document Intelligence\n provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities.\n\n\nOther libraries\n\n\nDocling\n is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion.

Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\n\n\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\n\n\n\n\nKey CORS concepts:\n\n\n\n\nSame-Origin Policy\n: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\n\n\nCORS Headers\n: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\n\n\nPreflight Requests\n: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\n\n\nCredentials\n: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\n\n\n\n\nIf you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header \nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n.\n\n\nHere are other common CORS headers:\n\n\nhttp\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n\n\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the \nCORSMiddleware\n middleware\n:\n\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n\n\nOr, provide more granular control:\n\n\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)\n```\n\n\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n\n\n```javascript\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n```\n\n\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\n\n\n\n\nCORS Checker\n: Test CORS configurations\n\n\nBrowser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\n\n\ncors-anywhere\n: CORS proxy for development\n\n\n\n\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\n\n\n\n\nNo 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header\n: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\n\n\nRequest header field not allowed\n: Add required headers to \nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers\n\n\nCredentials flag\n: Set both \ncredentials: 'include'\n and \nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n\n\nWild card error\n: Cannot use \n*\n with credentials; specify exact origins\n\n",

    "text": "Containers: Docker, Podman\n\n\nDocker\n and \nPodman\n are containerization tools that package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development and deployment.\n\n\nDocker is the industry standard. Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\n\n\nInitialize the container engine:\n\n\nbash\npodman machine init\npodman machine start\n\n\nCommon Operations. (You can use \ndocker\n instead of \npodman\n in the same way.)\n\n\n```bash\n\n\nPull an image\n\n\npodman pull python:3.11-slim\n\n\nRun a container\n\n\npodman run -it python:3.11-slim\n\n\nList containers\n\n\npodman ps -a\n\n\nStop container\n\n\npodman stop container_id\n\n\nScan image for vulnerabilities\n\n\npodman scan myapp:latest\n\n\nRemove container\n\n\npodman rm container_id\n\n\nRemove all stopped containers\n\n\npodman container prune\n```\n\n\nYou can create a \nDockerfile\n to build a container image. Here's a sample \nDockerfile\n that converts a Python script into a container image.\n\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n\n\nSet working directory\n\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\n\nTypically, you would use \nCOPY . .\n to copy files from the host machine,\n\n\nbut here we're just using a simple script.\n\n\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n\n\nRun the script\n\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\n\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n\n\n```bash\n\n\nCreate an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\n\n\npodman login docker.io\n\n\nBuild and run the container\n\n\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n\nPush the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.\n\n\npodman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello\n\n\nPush adding a specific tag, e.g. dev\n\n\nTAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG\n```\n\n\nTools:\n\n\n\n\nDive\n: Explore image layers\n\n\nSkopeo\n: Work with container images\n\n\nTrivy\n: Security scanner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: For Windows, see \nWSL 2 with Docker getting started\n\n",

    "text": "Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\n\n\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n. Find similar documents to a query.\n\n\nClassification\n. Classify text into categories.\n\n\nClustering\n. Group similar items into clusters.\n\n\nAnomaly Detection\n. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\n\n\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n\n| Feature     | Local Models               | API                       |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| \nPrivacy\n | High                       | Dependent on provider     |\n| \nCost\n    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             |\n| \nScale\n   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| \nQuality\n | Varies by model            | Typically high            |\n\n\nThe \nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)\n provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n\n\n\nRank\n. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n\n\nMemory Usage\n. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n\n\nEmbedding Dimensions\n. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n\n\nMax Tokens\n. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a \nsingle\n input.\n\n\nLook for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n\n\n\nLocal Embeddings\n\n\n\n\nHere's a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n\n```python\n\n\n/// script\n\n\nrequires-python = \"==3.12\"\n\n\ndependencies = [\n\n\n\"sentence-transformers\",\n\n\n\"httpx\",\n\n\n\"numpy\",\n\n\n]\n\n\n///\n\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif \nname\n == \"\nmain\n\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n\nNote the \nget_similarity\n function. It uses a \nCosine Similarity\n to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n\nOpenAI Embeddings\n\n\nFor comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the \nembed\n function in the earlier script:\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport httpx\n\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.post(\n            \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},\n            json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}\n        )\n        return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]\n```\n\n\n",

    "text": "Live Session: 15 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: Where can I find the uploaded documents?\n\n\nA1:\n The uploaded documents are added as part of a YouTube playlist. You should be able to see them on YouTube.\n\n\nQ2: How should I approach TDS?\n\n\nA2:\n The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n\nQ3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?\n\n\nA3:\n GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.\n\n\nQ4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?\n\n\nA4:\n The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.\n\n\nQ5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?\n\n\nA5:\n The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.\n\n\nQ6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?\n\n\nA6:\n The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.\n\n\nQ7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?\n\n\nA7:\n The TAs will hold sessions \nbefore\n the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.\n\n\nQ8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?\n\n\nA8:\n The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n\nQ9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?\n\n\nA9:\n Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.\n\n\nQ10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?\n\n\nA10:\n The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.\n\n\nQ11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?\n\n\nA11:\n It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.\n\n\nQ12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?\n\n\nA12:\n Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.\n\n\nQ13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?\n\n\nA13:\n Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.\n\n\nQ14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?\n\n\nA14:\n Learn by using the tools frequently in your",

The instructors will provide more support sessions.\n\n\nQ15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?\n\n\nA15:\n The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.\n\n\nQ16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?\n\n\nA16:\n Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.\n\n\nQ17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?\n\n\nA17:\n Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.\n\n\nQ18: What is a \"take-home open internet\" project?\n\n\nA18:\n You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.\n\n\nQ19: What weeks are relevant to each project?\n\n\nA19:\n Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.\n\n\nQ20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?\n\n\nA20:\n If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later.",

    "text": "Live Session: 16 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What will be covered in this session?\n\n\nA1:\n This session will cover concepts from Week 1 of the graded assignment in Tools in Data Science (TDS). The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session.\n\n\nQ2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?\n\n\nA2:\n The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube.\n\n\nQ3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?\n\n\nA3:\n The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question.\n\n\nQ4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?\n\n\nA4:\n UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.\n\n\nQ5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?\n\n\nA5:\n There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.\n\n\nQ6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?\n\n\nA6:\n No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.\n\n\nQ7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?\n\n\nA7:\n The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.\n\n\nQ8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?\n\n\nA8:\n Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.\n\n\nQ9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?\n\n\nA9:\n UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.\n\n\nQ10: How do we start the project?\n\n\nA10:\n There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.\n\n\nQ11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?\n\n\nA11:\n Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.\n\n\nQ12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?\n\n\nA12:\n It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).\n\n\nQ13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?\n\n\nA13:\n Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser.\n\n\nQ14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?\n\n\nA14:\n The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.\n\n\nQ15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?\n\n\nA15:\n The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the",

For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server.\n\n\nQ16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?\n\n\nA16:\n No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab.\n\n\nQ17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?\n\n\nA17:\n The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.\n\n\nQ18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?\n\n\nA18:\n The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure.\n\n\nQ19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?\n\n\nA19:\n HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs).\n\n\nQ20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?\n\n\nA20:\n The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. \ninnerText\n gives the text content of an element, while \ninnerHTML\n gives the entire HTML code. \ninnerText\n is generally preferred for data extraction.\n\n\nQ21: Are there other commands or attributes besides \ninnerText\n?\n\n\nA21:\n Yes, there are other attributes. \ntext\n is similar to \ninnerText\n, but \ninnerText\n is more reliable. Always use \ninnerText\n if \ntext\n doesn't work.\n\n\nQ22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?\n\n\nA22:\n Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#).\n\n\nQ23: While showing \ninnerText\n, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?\n\n\nA23:\n The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array.\n\n\nQ24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?\n\n\nA24:\n Enclose the code in a \ncopy()\n function. This copies the output to your clipboard.\n\n\nQ25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?\n\n\nA25:\n It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option.\n\n\nQ26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?\n\n\nA26:\n No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change.\n\n\nQ27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?\n\n\nA27:\n Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS",

If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element.\n\n\nQ28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?\n\n\nA28:\n No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements.\n\n\nQ29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?\n\n\nA29:\n The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.\n\n\nQ30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?\n\n\nA30:\n The syntax was \n$$(\".className\").map(...)\n. The \n$$\n selects elements with the specified class, and \nmap\n iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between \ninnerText\n and \ninnerHTML\n. \ninnerText\n returns only the text, while \ninnerHTML\n returns the entire HTML code. \ninnerText\n is generally preferred for data extraction. If \ntext\n doesn't work, use \ninnerText\n.\n\n\nQ31: Should the \ninnerText\n be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?\n\n\nA31:\n Use the text exactly as it appears.\n\n\nQ32: What is the role of npx in this context?\n\n\nA32:\n npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally.\n\n\nQ33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?\n\n\nA33:\n npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file.\n\n\nQ34: While showing \ninnerText\n, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?\n\n\nA34:\n That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability.\n\n\nQ35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?\n\n\nA35:\n Use the \ncopy()\n function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.\n\n\nQ36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?\n\n\nA36:\n For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them.",

    "text": "Live Session: 17 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: How to solve question number 7 (counting Wednesdays between two dates)?\n\n\nA1:\n Use Excel. Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.\n\n\nQ2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?\n\n\nA2:\n Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient.\n\n\nQ3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?\n\n\nA3:\n This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question.\n\n\nQ4: What is JSON and how is it used?\n\n\nA4:\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles.\n\n\nQ5: How can I access data from a JSON object?\n\n\nA5:\n The instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use \nstudents[2][name]\n. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values.\n\n\nQ6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?\n\n\nA6:\n Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched.\n\n\nQ7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?\n\n\nA7:\n The instructor demonstrates using the \nrequests\n library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response.\n\n\nQ8: What is Postman and how does it work?\n\n\nA8:\n Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose.\n\n\nQ9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?\n\n\nA9:\n The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (\n>\n) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail.\n\n\nQ10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?\n\n\nA10:\n For large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation.\n\n\nQ11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?\n\n\nA11:\n When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the \nencoding\n parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding.\n\n\nQ12: How to use Git",

This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative.\n\n\nQ14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?\n\n\nA14:\n The instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students' logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for students to report challenges and suggest improvements.",

    "text": "Live Session: 20 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What is an ML project, and how does it compare to the \"fitting of six models\" project?\n\n\nA1:\n An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The \"fitting of six models\" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.\n\n\nQ2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?\n\n\nA2:\n The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.\n\n\nQ3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?\n\n\nA3:\n The TDS project has three main parts:\n\n\n\n\nGitHub:\n For version control and code storage.\n\n\nDocker Hub:\n For containerizing and deploying the application.\n\n\nLLM (Large Language Model):\n For the core functionality of the application.\n   The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.\n\n\n\n\nQ4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?\n\n\nA4:\n The course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges.\n\n\nQ5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?\n\n\nA5:\n You can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance.\n\n\nQ6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?\n\n\nA6:\n Key tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application.\n\n\nQ7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?\n\n\nA7:\n VS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface.\n\n\nQ8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?\n\n\nA8:\n You can use the \nsed\n editor with the \n-i\n option for in-place editing and the \nI\n flag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with \nfind\n to locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure.\n\n\nQ9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?\n\n\nA9:\n You can use the \ngit remote add origin <repository URL>\n command to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page.\n\n\nQ10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?\n\n\nA10:\n If you're using HTTPS, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using \ngit config\n.

You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.\n\n\nQ23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?\n\n\nA23:\n You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password.\n\n\nQ24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?\n\n\nA24:\n You can generate SSH keys using the \nssh-keygen\n command and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token.\n\n\nQ25: What is the purpose of the \ngit remote add origin\n command?\n\n\nA25:\n This command adds a remote repository named \"origin\" to your local Git instance. \"Origin\" is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub.\n\n\nQ26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?\n\n\nA26:\n You can update the remote URL using the \ngit remote set-url origin <new URL>\n command, replacing \n<new URL>\n with the correct URL of your GitHub repository.\n\n\nQ27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?\n\n\nA27:\n Committing saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.\n\n\nQ28: How can I use VS Code to simplify Git operations?\n\n\nA28:\n VS Code has built-in Git integration and extensions that provide a graphical interface for managing your repository. You can stage changes, commit them with messages, push to remote repositories, manage branches, and perform other Git operations without using the command line.\n\n\nQ29: What is the significance of the \n.git\n folder in my project directory?\n\n\nA29:\n The \n.git\n folder is a hidden directory that contains all the information related to your Git instance, including the history of commits, branches, and other metadata. It's essential for version control and should not be modified directly.\n\n\nQ30: How can I ensure that my code is backed up and accessible to collaborators?\n\n\nA30:\n By pushing your code to a remote GitHub repository, you create a backup of your project and make it accessible to collaborators who have been granted access. This ensures that your code is safe even if your local machine encounters issues.",

    "text": "Live Session: 21 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: How much depth of knowledge is needed for the tools in the TDS course, specifically for GA1 and GA2?\n\n\nA1:\n The goal is to give you sufficient proficiency to execute the purpose of the tools, not to make you an expert. The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle.\n\n\nQ2: What is the tool to create the API?\n\n\nA2:\n FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session.\n\n\nQ3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?\n\n\nA3:\n Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.\n\n\nQ4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?\n\n\nA4:\n NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time.\n\n\nQ5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?\n\n\nA5:\n You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub.\n\n\nQ6: What is the tool to create the API?\n\n\nA6:\n FastAPI.\n\n\nQ7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?\n\n\nA7:\n Whatever you last submitted is your final score.\n\n\nQ8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?\n\n\nA8:\n This will be addressed toward the end of the session.\n\n\nQ9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?\n\n\nA9:\n Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box.\n\n\nQ10: What is CI/CD?\n\n\nA10:\n Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow.\n\n\nQ11: What is Vercel?\n\n\nA11:\n Vercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo.\n\n\nQ12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?\n\n\nA12:\n Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name",

You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos.\n\n\nQ13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?\n\n\nA13:\n Yes, that's possible.\n\n\nQ14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?\n\n\nA14:\n There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together.\n\n\nQ15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?\n\n\nA15:\n Yes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven't changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow.",

    "text": "Live Session: 22 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?\n\n\nA1:\n Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.\n\n\nQ2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?\n\n\nA2:\n Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.\n\n\nQ3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?\n\n\nA3:\n Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.\n\n\nQ4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?\n\n\nA4:\n For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.\n\n\nQ5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?\n\n\nA5:\n A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.\n\n\nQ6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?\n\n\nA6:\n Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.\n\n\nQ7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?\n\n\nA7:\n All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.\n\n\nQ8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?\n\n\nA8:\n GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.\n\n\nQ9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?\n\n\nA9:\n There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.\n\n\nQ10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: \"Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original.\" I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?\n\n\nA10:\n The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.\n\n\nQ11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?\n\n\nA11:\n The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.\n\n\nQ12: Should I be worried that",

It's not a separate project like in other courses.\n\n\nQ12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?\n\n\nA12:\n No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.\n\n\nQ13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?\n\n\nA13:\n Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.\n\n\nQ14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?\n\n\nA14:\n You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The \ndiff\n command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.\n\n\nQ15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?\n\n\nA15:\n The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question.",

    "text": "Live Session: 23 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: How can I compare two files using the command line?\n\n\nA1:\n You can use the \ndiff\n command in bash, or the \ngit diff\n command if you've initialized a git repository. The \ndiff\n command shows the differences between two files directly. \ngit diff\n compares commits in a git repository.\n\n\nQ2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?\n\n\nA2:\n Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot.\n\n\nQ3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?\n\n\nA3:\n I used a bash script that combines the \nfind\n command (to locate files of a specific type, like \n.txt\n files) and the \nmv\n command (to move them). The \nfind\n command searches the current directory (\n./\n) for files (\n-type f\n) and the \n-exec\n option executes the \nmv\n command on each file found. The curly braces \n{}\n are placeholders for the filenames.\n\n\nQ4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?\n\n\nA4:\n You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries.\n\n\nQ5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?\n\n\nA5:\n First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using \npython -m venv <env_name>\n. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., \n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n). Install Flask using \npip install flask\n. Create a \n.gitignore\n file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a \nvercel.json\n file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).\n\n\nQ6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?\n\n\nA6:\n When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove \ndebug=True\n from your Flask application before deploying to production.\n\n\nQ7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?\n\n\nA7:\n ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.\n\n\nQ8: What is ngrok and how does it work?\n\n\nA8:\n ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\n\n\nQ9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?\n\n\nA9:\n A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment",

This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a \n.gitignore\n file to exclude the virtual environment folder.",

    "text": "Live Session: 28 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one?\n\n\nA1:\n I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session.\n\n\nQ2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?\n\n\nA2:\n No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later.\n\n\nQ3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?\n\n\nA3:\n Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.\n\n\nQ4: What is the concept behind Project One?\n\n\nA4:\n Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.\n\n\nQ5: What kind of tasks can I expect?\n\n\nA5:\n There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.\n\n\nQ6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?\n\n\nA6:\n I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.\n\n\nQ7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?\n\n\nA7:\n Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.\n\n\nQ8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?\n\n\nA8:\n Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.\n\n\nQ9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?\n\n\nA9:\n Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.\n\n\nQ10: What's required for grading?\n\n\nA10:\n Your repository must meet these criteria:\n\n\n\n\nIt must exist and be publicly accessible.\n\n\nIt must have a license file (MIT license).\n\n\nIt must have a valid Dockerfile.\n\n\nThe Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command.\n\n\nThe Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated.\n\n\nQ11: What is the grading scheme?\n\n\nA11:\n Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase",

These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated.\n\n\nQ11: What is the grading scheme?\n\n\nA11:\n Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12.\n\n\nQ12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?\n\n\nA12:\n No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code.\n\n\nQ13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?\n\n\nA13:\n You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code.\n\n\nQ14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?\n\n\nA14:\n All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register.\n\n\nQ15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?\n\n\nA15:\n We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n\nQ16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?\n\n\nA16:\n We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n\nQ17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?\n\n\nA17:\n Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.\n\n\nQ18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?\n\n\nA18:\n Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.\n\n\nQ19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?\n\n\nA19:\n Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.\n\n\nQ20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?\n\n\nA20:\n Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11",

We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.\n\n\nQ20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?\n\n\nA20:\n Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n\nQ21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?\n\n\nA21:\n You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.\n\n\nQ22: Why isn't it reflecting?\n\n\nA22:\n It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n\nQ23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?\n\n\nA23:\n No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.\n\n\nQ24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?\n\n\nA24:\n The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.\n\n\nQ25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?\n\n\nA25:\n No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work.\n\n\nQ26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?\n\n\nA26:\n No, you don't have to pay.\n\n\nQ27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?\n\n\nA27:\n Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.\n\n\nQ28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?\n\n\nA28:\n Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then.\n\n\nQ29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?\n\n\nA29:\n Sure.\n\n\nQ30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say \"yes\"?\n\n\nA30:\n You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.\n\n\nQ31: Why isn't it reflecting?\n\n\nA31:\n It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n\nQ32: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error.

For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n\nQ33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?\n\n\nA33:\n Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs.\n\n\nQ34: How do I get my API key?\n\n\nA34:\n You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs.\n\n\nQ35: What is a proxy?\n\n\nA35:\n OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI.\n\n\nQ36: How many tokens does a prompt take?\n\n\nA36:\n The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage.\n\n\nQ37: How can I keep track of token usage?\n\n\nA37:\n Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.\n\n\nQ38: How are API calls made?\n\n\nA38:\n You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output.\n\n\nQ39: Can you share the notebook file?\n\n\nA39:\n No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available.\n\n\nQ40: What about function calling?\n\n\nA40:\n We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate.\n\n\nQ41: What about embeddings?\n\n\nA41:\n Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session.\n\n\nQ42: What about text extraction?\n\n\nA42:\n We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n\nQ43: What about Base64 encoding?\n\n\nA43:\n We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API.\n\n\nQ44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?\n\n\nA44:\n Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would",

We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n\nQ45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?\n\n\nA45:\n Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples.\n\n\nQ46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.\n\n\nA46:\n The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?",

    "text": "Live Session: 29 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: I am a student, and I joined the session without using my IITM ID. How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?\n\n\nA1:\n You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID.\n\n\nQ2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?\n\n\nA2:\n Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic.\n\n\nQ3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?\n\n\nA3:\n No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.\n\n\nQ4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.\n\n\nA4:\n That would be great.\n\n\nQ5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.\n\n\nA5:\n I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks.\n\n\nQ6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?\n\n\nA6:\n Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)\n\n\nQ7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?\n\n\nA7:\n Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending \n/api\n to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in \nFlask\n in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.)\n\n\nQ8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?\n\n\nA8:\n Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is",

I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used \nhttp.server\n. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses \nhttp.server\n. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate \nrequirements.txt\n file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says \nclass\n (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response.\n\n\nQ9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)\n\n\nA9:\n Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.)\n\n\nQ10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...\n\n\nA10:\n It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\n\n\nQ11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...\n\n\nA11:\n There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn't give you a problem anymore.\n\n\nQ12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not",

It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?\n\n\nA12:\n The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word \nclass\n itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called \nclass\n (CLASSS) without the underscore.\n\n\nQ13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?\n\n\nA13:\n Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add \n/api\n. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the \nrequests\n module instead of the \ncurl\n command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n\nQ14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.\n\n\nA14:\n Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn't cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it.\n\n\nQ15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I'm giving the URL, but it's giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I'll show you. Should I run this first?\n\n\nA15:\n Add \n/api\n at the end of that. That's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There's some logic error. You're getting a Cloudflare error. That's something to do with the CDN service giving some sort of response.

I don't know how...\n\n\nA17:\n In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse.

What you are using is actually OpenAI's own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help.

You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n\nQ22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How?\n\n\nA22:\n This was a really fascinating question. There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well.\n\n\nQ23: Can I get the code for this?\n\n\nA23:\n He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it.\n\n\nQ24: I've taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don't submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.\n\n\nA24:\n Right, right.\n\n\nQ25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I'm also getting a very similar error. I couldn't follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end.

I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error.

You'll have to stop that. You'll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It's generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for... can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There's a problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself.",

    "text": "Live Session: 30 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: My screen is visible?\n\n\nA1:\n Yes, your screen is visible.\n\n\nQ2: I posted on Discourse and emailed you about a problem deploying a Flask application on Vercel. The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?\n\n\nA2:\n The error likely stems from your \nrequirements.txt\n file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a \nrequirements.txt\n file without manually typing it.\n\n\nQ3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.\n\n\nA3:\n Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one.\n\n\nQ4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?\n\n\nA4:\n Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the \nrequirements.txt\n file. You can use a single-line command in Python: \npip freeze > requirements.txt\n. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment).\n\n\nQ5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.\n\n\nA5:\n Let's try \npython -m venv venv\n in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library.\n\n\nQ6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?\n\n\nA6:\n No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign.\n\n\nQ7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.\n\n\nA7:\n I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API.\n\n\nQ8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).\n\n\nA8:\n I'm just demonstrating how to create the \nrequirements.txt\n file.\n\n\nQ9: If I'm running a virtual environment with \nuv\n, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?\n\n\nA9:\n Exactly. That's a downside of \nuv\n. When using \nuv\n, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your \nrequirements.txt\n file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, \nuv\n is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.\n\n\nQ10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.\n\n\nA10:\n Your server is not running. Run \nvercel deploy --prod\n again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to",

I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code.\n\n\nQ11: I'm using httpx.\n\n\nA11:\n Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the \nrequirements.txt\n file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code?\n\n\nQ12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add \n/api\n to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.\n\n\nA12:\n That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add \n../\n before \nq\n to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy.\n\n\nQ13: Should I remove the \n.vercel\n folder and redeploy?\n\n\nA13:\n No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n\nQ14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?\n\n\nA14:\n No, they are in the \nvercel-python/api\n directory.\n\n\nQ15: I don't know how to use \nclass\n as a variable name in question 9.\n\n\nA15:\n \nclass\n is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means.\n\n\nQ16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?\n\n\nA16:\n You need to use lists. Import \nList\n from the \ntyping\n library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is \nclassName\n, but we can use the \nclass\n parameter using this alias.\n\n\nQ17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.\n\n\nA17:\n You are using \nhttpx\n. You're also using \nindex.py\n. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server.\n\n\nQ18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.\n\n\nA18:\n Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.\n\n\n",

Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added \n/api\n to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure.\n\n\nQ20: I created the directory, then another folder \napi\n, and then \nindex.py\n inside \napi\n.\n\n\nA20:\n Should I remove the \n.vercel\n folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n\nQ21: Show your folder structure.\n\n\nA21:\n I created the directory, then another folder \napi\n, and then \nindex.py\n inside \napi\n.\n\n\nQ22: If I use \nuv\n, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?\n\n\nA22:\n Yes.\n\n\nQ23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?\n\n\nA23:\n I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git.\n\n\nQ24: Can we use the query function?\n\n\nA24:\n Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi.\n\n\nQ25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?\n\n\nA25:\n That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. \nvalues\n will return this.\n\n\nQ26: Question 9: I don't know how to use \nclass\n as a variable name.\n\n\nA26:\n \nclass\n is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias.\n\n\nQ27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?\n\n\nA27:\n Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me.\n\n\nQ28: Can we use \nhttpie\n instead of \nrequests\n?\n\n\nA28:\n Yes, you can change it to \nhttpx\n. \nhttpie\n is a command-line tool, not a Python module. I'm not sure about \nhttpie\n.\n\n\nQ29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?\n\n\nA29",

I'm not sure about \nhttpie\n.\n\n\nQ29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?\n\n\nA29:\n No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for \nbiycle\n.\n\n\nQ30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?\n\n\nA30:\n You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array.\n\n\nQ31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?\n\n\nA31:\n Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called \nword2vec\n. It's deployed on Hugging Face.\n\n\nQ32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?\n\n\nA32:\n I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.\n\n\nQ33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?\n\n\nA33:\n Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\".\n\n\nQ34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?\n\n\nA34:\n I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course.\n\n\nQ35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.\n\n\nA35:\n It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD.\n\n\nQ36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?\n\n\nA36:\n You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work.\n\n\nQ37: My last",

Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work.\n\n\nQ37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?\n\n\nA37:\n I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle.\n\n\nQ38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?\n\n\nA38:\n No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for \nbiycle\n.\n\n\nQ39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?\n\n\nA39:\n We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only.\n\n\nQ40: My first doubt is, can we use \nhttpie\n instead of \nrequests\n?\n\n\nA40:\n Yes, you can change it to \nhttpx\n. I'm not sure about \nhttpie\n. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. \nrequests\n is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the \nrequests\n module.\n\n\nQ41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?\n\n\nA41:\n That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape.\n\n\nQ42: Does it involve SVD?\n\n\nA42:\n I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.\n\n\nQ43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten.",

You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.\n\n\nA43:\n You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\". That's how computers store this information.",

    "text": "Live Session: 31 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: In today's session, what will be covered?\n\n\nA1:\n We will be discussing the function calling part of OpenAI. We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function.\n\n\nQ2: What is the first step in the process?\n\n\nA2:\n First, we import the \nrequests\n library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request.\n\n\nQ3: What is the goal of the program?\n\n\nA3:\n The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders.\n\n\nQ4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?\n\n\nA4:\n The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format.\n\n\nQ5: What are the predefined functions?\n\n\nA5:\n The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include \nget_weather_info\n (which takes a location as a parameter) and \nbest_hotels\n (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt.\n\n\nQ6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?\n\n\nA6:\n OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format.\n\n\nQ7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?\n\n\nA7:\n Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.\n\n\nQ8: Is the \norder\n function dependent on the above-written cell?\n\n\nA8:\n Yes, the \norder\n function uses variables defined in previous cells.\n\n\nQ9: How is the JSON response handled?\n\n\nA9:\n The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.\n\n\nQ10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?\n\n\nA10:\n You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.\n\n\nQ11: How can we integrate a voice model?\n\n\nA11:\n You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.\n\n\nQ12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?\n\n\nA12:\n We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.\n\n\nQ13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?\n\n\nA13:\n Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.\n\n\nQ14: What if the \norder\n function doesn't work as expected?\n\n\nA14:\n The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using \njson.loads\n to convert strings to JSON objects.\n\n\nQ15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?\n\n\nA15:\n The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45",

It's recommended to save your work frequently.\n\n\nQ16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?\n\n\nA16:\n The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters.\n\n\nQ17: How do we handle the \nUUID\n generation to ensure uniqueness?\n\n\nA17:\n The \nUUID\n library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation.\n\n\nQ18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?\n\n\nA18:\n Instead of using absolute paths (\nos.path\n), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a \n.env\n file to store sensitive information like API keys.\n\n\nQ19: What is the overall approach to building this application?\n\n\nA19:\n The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors.",

    "text": "Live Session: 01 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: Can I use Python notebooks instead of VS Code for this project?\n\n\nA1:\n You can use Python notebooks for interactive development and debugging, but for a production environment, a script file (.py) is better because it allows for a defined order of execution, unlike notebooks where code cells may not necessarily branch from one section to another. Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step.\n\n\nQ2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?\n\n\nA2:\n That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors.\n\n\nQ3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?\n\n\nA3:\n Use \nuv\n. \nuv\n is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and \nuv\n handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.\n\n\nQ4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?\n\n\nA4:\n You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.\n\n\nQ5: What is the purpose of \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n?\n\n\nA5:\n This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.\n\n\nQ6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?\n\n\nA6:\n No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling.\n\n\nQ7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?\n\n\nA7:\n You pass them in the URL itself. For example, \nlocalhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29\n. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.\n\n\nQ8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?\n\n\nA8:\n Several things could cause this. Ensure that:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nprices\n dictionary is defined globally, not within a function.\n\n\nThe prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time).\n\n\nThe application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity).\n\n\nYou are using the correct key in the JSON response (\n.keys()\n).\n\n\n\n\nQ9: How do I use Docker?\n\n\nA9:\n Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using \npodman build -t tds-hello .\n (the \n.\n refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using \npodman run -it tds-hello bash\n. The \nbash\n command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.\n\n\nQ10: What are the use cases for Docker?\n\n\nA10",

The \nbash\n command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.\n\n\nQ10: What are the use cases for Docker?\n\n\nA10:\n Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\n\n\nQ11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?\n\n\nA11:\n The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically.",

    "text": "Live Session: 04 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: I'm having trouble with question 7 of the GA3 assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing \"method not allowed\".\n\n\nA1:\n When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.\n\n\nQ2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.\n\n\nA2:\n Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.\n\n\nQ3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?\n\n\nA3:\n Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces \n{}\n. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button.\n\n\nQ4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?\n\n\nA4:\n Yes, you are. Since you don't have a \n.env\n file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with \nreturn \"hello\"\n to test. Restart the server.\n\n\nQ5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.\n\n\nA5:\n Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).\n\n\nQ6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?\n\n\nA6:\n Recently.\n\n\nQ7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?\n\n\nA7:\n T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T\n\n\nQ8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?\n\n\nA8:\n Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy.\n\n\nQ9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.\n\n\nA9:\n Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client.\n\n\nQ10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?\n\n\nA10:\n Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use \n*\n, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from \nserver1\n and \nserver2\n, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.\n\n\nQ11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.\n\n\nA11:\n Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.\n\n\nQ12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.\n\n\nA12:\n Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.\n\n\nQ13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?\n\n\nA13:\n In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local",

The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.\n\n\nQ14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?\n\n\nA14:\n If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.\n\n\nQ15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?\n\n\nA15:\n That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.\n\n\nQ16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?\n\n\nA16:\n Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.\n\n\nQ17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?\n\n\nA17:\n It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process.\n\n\nQ18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).\n\n\nA18:\n Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.\n\n\nQ19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?\n\n\nA19:\n That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.\n\n\nQ20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?\n\n\nA20:\n You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks.\n\n\nQ21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.\n\n\nA21:\n That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.\n\n\nQ22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?\n\n\nA22:\n The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.\n\n\nQ23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?\n\n\nA23:\n There might be other tasks that require different inputs.\n\n\nQ24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?\n\n\nA24:\n We use the \nAllow-Origin\n header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use \n*\n, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.\n\n\nQ25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?\n\n\nA25:\n The trigger point is the same",

The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.\n\n\nQ27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?\n\n\nA27:\n The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.\n\n\nQ28: For task 3, what is the expected output?\n\n\nA28:\n The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.\n\n\nQ29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?\n\n\nA29:\n We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.\n\n\nQ30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?\n\n\nA30:\n You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.\n\n\nQ31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out.

    "text": "Live Session: 06 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: In this GA4 session, what's new compared to previous GAs?\n\n\nA1:\n The trajectory has moved from hard to easy. This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.\n\n\nQ2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?\n\n\nA2:\n This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The \nIMPORTHTML\n function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.\n\n\nQ3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?\n\n\nA3:\n I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.\n\n\nQ4: What do the parameters in the \nIMPORTHTML\n function mean?\n\n\nA4:\n The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).\n\n\nQ5: How does the \nIMPORTHTML\n function automatically find the table?\n\n\nA5:\n It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly.\n\n\nQ6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?\n\n\nA6:\n There are three ways:\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1:\n If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly.\n\n\nMethod 2:\n Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The \n$$\n operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The \n.\n prefix selects elements by class, and \n#\n selects by ID.\n\n\nMethod 3:\n Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.\n\n\n\n\nQ7: What's the difference between \ninnerText\n and \ninnerHTML\n?\n\n\nA7:\n \ninnerText\n returns only the text content of an element, while \ninnerHTML\n returns the entire HTML code within that element.\n\n\nQ8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".\n\n\nA8:\n When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).\n\n\nQ9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?\n\n\nA9:\n The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting.",

    "text": "Live Session: 07 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQ1: How difficult are the TDS assignments?\n\n\nA1:\n The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.\n\n\nQ2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?\n\n\nA2:\n It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.\n\n\nQ3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?\n\n\nA3:\n First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.\n\n\nQ4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?\n\n\nA4:\n JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key.\n\n\nQ5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?\n\n\nA5:\n The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.\n\n\nQ6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?\n\n\nA6:\n Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States).\n\n\nQ7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?\n\n\nA7:\n The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the \nfind_all\n function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between \nfind\n and \nfindall\n functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.\n\n\nQ8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?\n\n\nA8:\n If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values.\n\n\nQ9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?\n\n\nA9:\n The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the \nto_csv\n method.\n\n\nQ10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?\n\n\nA10:\n Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., \npage=2\n for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.\n\n\nQ11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?\n\n\nA11:\n Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond.

    "text": "LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act\n\n\nLLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Makes an Agent?\n\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\n\n\n\nLLM Brain\n: Makes decisions about what to do next\n\n\nTools\n: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n\n\nMemory\n: Retains context across multiple steps\n\n\n\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\n\n\n\nObserve the environment\n\n\nThink about what to do\n\n\nTake action using tools\n\n\nObserve results\n\n\nRepeat until task completion\n\n\n\n\nCommand-Line Agent Example\n\n\nWe've created a minimal command-line agent called \nllm-cmd-agent.py\n that:\n\n\n\n\nTakes a task description from the command line\n\n\nGenerates code to accomplish the task\n\n\nAutomatically extracts and executes the code\n\n\nPasses the results back to the LLM\n\n\nProvides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\n\n\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n\nbash\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\n\n\nThe agent will:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n\n\nExecute the script in a subprocess\n\n\nCapture the output (stdout and stderr)\n\n\nPass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n\n\nPresent a final answer to the user\n\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\n\n\n\nInitial prompt to generate a shell script\n\n\nCode extraction from the LLM response\n\n\nCode execution in a subprocess\n\n\nResult interpretation by the LLM\n\n\nError handling and retry logic if needed\n\n\n\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\n\n\n\nPlanning (generating code)\n\n\nExecution (running the code)\n\n\nReflection (interpreting results)\n\n\nAdaptation (fixing errors if needed)\n\n\n\n\nAgent Architectures\n\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\n\n\n\nReAct\n (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\n\n\nReflexion\n: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\n\n\nMRKL\n (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\n\n\nPlan-and-Execute\n: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Applications\n\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\n\n\n\nResearch assistants\n that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n\n\nCoding assistants\n that write, debug, and explain code\n\n\nData analysis agents\n that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n\n\nCustomer service agents\n that handle queries and perform actions\n\n\nPersonal assistants\n that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\n\n\n\n\nProject Ideas\n\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\n\n\n\nStudy buddy agent\n: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\n\n\nJob application assistant\n: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\n\n\nPersonal finance agent\n: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\n\n\nHealth and fitness coach\n: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\n\n\nCourse project helper\n: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\n\n\nClear instructions\n: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations\n\n\nEffective tool design\n: Create tools that are specific and reliable\n\n\nRobust error handling\n: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\n\n\nMemory management\n: Balance context retention with token efficiency\n\n\nUser feedback\n: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\n\n\n\n\nLimitations and Challenges\n\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\n\n\n\nHallucination\n: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n\n\nPlanning limitations\n: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n\n\nTool integration complexity\n: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\n\n\nContext window constraints\n: Limited memory for long-running tasks\n\n\nSecurity",

    "text": "Parsing JSON\n\n\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\n\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n\n\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n\n\n| Tool                                        | Extract from JSON...   | Why                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| \njq\n | JSON in the shell      | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing                    |\n| \nJMESPath\n               | JSON in Python         | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax                        |\n| \nijson\n              | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently               |\n| \nPandas\n              | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data                                  |\n| \nSQL JSON\n             | JSON in databases      | Combine structured and semi-structured data                       |\n| \nDuckDB\n           | JSON anywhere          | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nUse Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n\n\nLeverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n\n\nApply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n\n\n\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n\n\n\nJSONPath Online Evaluator\n: Test JSON queries\n\n\njq play\n: Interactive jq query testing\n\n\nDuckDB JSON Tutorial\n: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\n\n\n\n\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\n\n\njq\n is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n\nExample:\n Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n\n```bash\n\n\nExtract specific fields from JSONL\n\n\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n\nTransform JSON structure\n\n\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n\nFilter and aggregate\n\n\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\n```\n\n\nJMESPath Queries\n\n\nJMESPath\n offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n\nExample:\n Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n\n```python\nimport jmespath\n\n\nExample queries\n\n\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\nFind all cities with population > 700000\n\n\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > \n700000\n].name\", data)\n```\n\n\nStreaming with ijson\n\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. \nijson\n lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n\nExample:\n Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without",

When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n\nExample:\n Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\nParse JSON strings in a column\n\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n\nNormalize nested JSON columns\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\n```\n\n\nSQL JSON Functions\n\n\nSQL\n supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n\nSQLite\n,\n\nPostgreSQL\n, and\n\nMySQL\n.\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n\nExample:\n An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n\nsql\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\n\n\nDuckDB JSON Processing\n\n\nDuckDB\n shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n\nExample:\n Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n\nsql\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100",

    "text": "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent\n\n\nThis project is due on 16 Feb 2025 EoD IST. Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.\n\n\nFor questions, \nuse this Discourse thread\n.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nYou have joined the operations team at \nDataWorks Solutions\n, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\n\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\n\n\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results.\n\n\nCreate an API\n\n\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\n\n\n\n\nPOST \n/run?task=<task description>\n\n  Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.\n\n\nIf successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\n\n\nIf unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\n\n\nIf unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\n\n\nThe body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n\n\nGET \n/read?path=<file path>\n\n  Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.\n\n\nIf successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\n\n\nIf the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\n\n\n\n\nPhase A: Handle Operations Tasks\n\n\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:\n\n\n\n\nA1\n. Install \nuv\n (if required) and run \nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py\n with \n${user.email}\n as the only argument. (\nNOTE\n: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\n\n\nA2\n. Format the contents of \n/data/format.md\n using \nprettier@3.4.2\n, updating the file in-place\n\n\nA3\n. The file \n/data/dates.txt\n contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to \n/data/dates-wednesdays.txt\n\n\nA4\n. Sort the array of contacts in \n/data/contacts.json\n by \nlast_name\n, then \nfirst_name\n, and write the result to \n/data/contacts-sorted.json\n\n\nA5\n. Write the first line of the 10 most recent \n.log\n file in \n/data/logs/\n to \n/data/logs-recent.txt\n, most recent first\n\n\nA6\n. Find all Markdown (\n.md\n) files in \n/data/docs/\n. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with \n#\n). Create an index file \n/data/docs/index.json\n that maps each filename (without the \n/data/docs/\n prefix) to its title (e.g. \n{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}\n)\n\n\nA7\n. \n/data/email.txt\n contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email",

    "text": "Prompt Engineering\n\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nOpenAI\n\n\n\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\n\nUse prompt optimizers\n\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic Prompt Optimizer\n\n\nOpenAI Prompt Generation\n\n\nGoogle AI-powered prompt writing tools\n\n\n\n\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\n\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n\n\n\nBAD\n: \nExplain gravitation lensing.\n (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n\n\nGOOD\n: \nExplain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\nThe clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\nFor example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\nSay, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic\n\n| \nOpenAI\n\n| \nGoogle\n\n\nGive examples\n\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n\n\n\nBAD\n: \nExplain how to tie a bow tie.\n (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n\n\n\n\nGOOD\n:\n  \nExplain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight...\n\n\n\n\nTo tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through...\n\n\n\n\nNow, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie.\n (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n\n\n\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\nGiving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic\n\n| \nOpenAI\n\n| \nGoogle\n\n\nThink step by step\n\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n\n\n\nBAD\n: \nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied?\n (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n\n\nGOOD\n: \nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step.\n (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\nThat's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\nInstead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\nFor example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic\n\n| \nOpenAI\n\n| \nGoogle\n\n\nAssign a role\n\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model.

    "text": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\n\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.\n\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\n\nAnswer: fat arrow\n\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n\n\nAnswer: node.getChildren()\n\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\"\n\n\nAnswer: trivia\n\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n\n\nAnswer: !!\n\n\n```\n\n\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code.

Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you passed, don't enroll again\n\n\nThe course is public, so you can always audit it.\n\nAlso, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what you've learnt.\n\n\n\n\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\n\n\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the \ncommit history\n for changes.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\n and concepts to \nbuild\n models and apps.\n\n\nDeployment Tools\n and concepts to \npublish\n what you built.\n\n\nLarge Language Models\n that make your work easier and your apps smarter.\n\n\nData Sourcing\n to get data from",

    "text": "Serverless hosting: Vercel\n\n\n\n\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that \ndon't need to run all the time\n. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n\n\n\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n\n\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n\n\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n\n\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n\n\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\n\n\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n\n\n\nYou can't \npip install\n packages - you have to use \nrequirements.txt\n\n\nYou can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n\n\nYou can't run commands (e.g. \nsubprocess.run()\n)\n\n\n\n\nVercel\n is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\n\nHere's a \nquickstart\n. \nSign-up with Vercel\n. Create an empty \ngit\n repo with this \napi/index.py\n file.\n\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a \nrequirements.txt\n file with \nfastapi\n as a dependency.\n\n\ntext\nfastapi\n\n\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. \nmain.py\n.\n\n\n```python\n\n\nmain.py\n\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\n```\n\n\nAdd a \nvercel.json\n file to the root of your repository.\n\n\njson\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}\n\n\nOn the command line, run:\n\n\n\n\nnpx vercel\n to deploy a test version\n\n\nnpx vercel --prod\n to deploy to production\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n.

    "text": "Tools in Data Science - Jan 2025\n\n\nTools in Data Science\n is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n\n\n\nThis course exposes you to real-life tools\n\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more.

It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\n\n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.\n\n\n\n\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\n\n\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the \ncommit history\n for changes.\n\n\nReleased content:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\n and concepts to \nbuild\n models and apps. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\nDeployment Tools\n and concepts to \npublish\n what you built. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\nLarge Language Models\n that make your work easier and your apps smarter. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\nData Sourcing\n to get data from the web, files, and databases. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\nData Preparation\n to clean up and convert the inputs to the right format. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\n\n\nProject 1\n to build an LLM-based automation agent. \nDiscussion Thread\n\n\nWork in progress:\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis\n to find surprising insights in the data.\n\n\nData Visualization\n to communicate those insights as visual stories.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluations are mostly open Internet\n\n\n| Exam                                                                       | Type                              | Weight |      Release Date |   Submission Date |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -----: | ----------------: | ----------------: |\n| GA: Graded assignments                                                     | Best 4 out of 7 ‡                 |    15% |                   |                   |\n| \n",

You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\n\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\n\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\n\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\n\nThat’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\ndef do_GET(self):\nself.send_response(200)\nself.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\nself.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\nself.end_headers()\nself.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\nreturn\n\nNotice there is no\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\ncode block.\n\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module.

You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\n\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.\n\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\n\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\n\nIn the meanwhile:\n\nThere are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible",

Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-01-27T04:20:07.358Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\nthank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir\n\n[2025-01-27T13:16:28.130Z] Shalini Saravanan (@24f2006531)\nOnce i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong.

Just ignore for now once you got it working.

Try using\n127.0.0.1\nand check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with\nhttp://localhost:8000/api\nto see if it works.\n\nIf that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the\nipconfig\ncommand to check the correct IP address.\n\nWe usually address doubts at the end of every session.

Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\n\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\n\nThis renders\nname == main\npart of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\n\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You\ndo not\ncreate serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\n\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\n\nThanks for your input.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-01T07:10:12.783Z] Yashvardhan (@23f2004644)\n@carl",

While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.\n\nI want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions.\n\nThank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance.\n\n@s.anand\n\nChatGPT can make mistakes.

It’s an evolving site. We keep adding whatever’s required that’s (a) new or (b) unknown to some students.\n\nPlease go through the content. Where you find gaps, please let us know. If it’s a need across multiple students, we’ll find / create the content around it.\n\nLooking forward to your project!\n",

Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to\nhttp://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings\nwith required headers. And, then calculate\nsimilarity_scores\nsimply using\n\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}}{|\\mathbf{A}| |\\mathbf{B}|}\n\nwhich in python syntax is-\n\nnp.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))\n\n[2025-02-05T18:33:06.841Z] Sudhish Narayan S (@Sudhishnarayan)\nSir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes.

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\n\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.\n\n[2025-01-18T18:33:47.373Z] B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (@23f2000573)\ni think you would have to mail this to the support\n\n[2025-01-19T15:17:29.605Z] Shaurya Sharad Shukla (@TRIGON)\n@Rrishit\n, please do share the response you receive (or maybe already have) from Support, regarding this, here.\n",

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\n\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\n\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\n\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.\n",

Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.\n\nI just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.\n\nIn other words getting 10/10 in\nevaluate.py\ndoes NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.\n\nSo do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of\nevaluate.py\n. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general\nidea\nof the task.\n\nThat said,\nevaluate.py\nis a good way to know what to expect.

Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\n\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\n\nA word of caution:\n\n(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)\nYour requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (\npossibly your first task\n) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-11T07:01:21.237Z] Telvin Varghese (@22f2001640)\nRespected\n@s.anand\n\n@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\n,\n\nIs anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page?

An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.\n\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.\n\nI am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.\n\nI beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.\n\nThank you for considering my heartfelt request.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRishit Jain\n\n(24F2004595)\n\n[2025-02-16T18:55:21.332Z] Prasoon Shukla (@psisaddicted)\nAlthough couldn’t complete handling every task, but really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot throughout the process.

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\n[2025-01-31T06:50:45.102Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\nIsolation\n– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\nReproducibility\n– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\nPortability\n– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n• Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n• If you\ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n• If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\n\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-01-31T06:54:16.291Z] Harsh Shah (@23f2003845)\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you",

But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n24f2006531:\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that,\npip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n\n[2025-01-31T07:07:47.354Z] Shalini Saravanan (@24f2006531)\nThank you sir for clarifying.\n\ncarlton:\n\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.\n",

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.\n\n[2025-02-05T05:06:15.787Z] HariOm Pandey (@21f3002112)\n@carlton\nsir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\n\n[2025-02-06T05:49:08.446Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nHi Hari,\n\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\nKind regards\n",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\n[2025-02-23T14:10:48.269Z] Vicky Kumar (@Algsoch)\nCan anyone provide solution of question 5 related to duckdb module\n\nplease\n\n[2025-02-24T05:44:46.473Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\nis there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake.

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.\n\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.\n\nWould it be possible to implement this change?\n\n[2025-02-15T16:52:14.578Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)\n\n",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\n\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\nKind regards\n",

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\n\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.\n\nThen once you realised your mistake, on\nFeb 17th at 9:11 pm IST\ni.e\nyesteday\n, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\n\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]\n\nimage\n250×534 3.92 KB\n\n[/quote]\n\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\n\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-18T06:35:49.560Z] Arnav Mehta  (@21f3002647)\n@carlton\nsir\n\nYes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.\n\nI understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered\n\nKind regards,\n\nArnav Mehta\n\n21f3002647\n\n",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\n[2025-02-22T08:30:32.330Z] B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (@23f2000573)\ni downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\n\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online\n, it worked\n",

I request the official post to cover these.\n\nSyllabus\n\nkindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice\n\nI did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me.

Or is the ROE more complex structured ?\n\nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\n\n[2025-02-23T05:33:31.105Z] Kumar Rishabh  (@Rishabh2)\nSir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\n\n[2025-02-24T07:40:15.196Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nROEs are always unique.

Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-24T07:52:35.373Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\n\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”\n\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\n\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-24T08:39:53.315Z] Yogesh (@Yogesh1)\nIs there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?\n\n[2025-02-24T08:59:27.794Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nDepends on the collaborators",

If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\n\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.\n",

Thanks in advance.\n\n[2025-02-24T09:16:21.851Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nProject 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\n\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\n\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\n\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\n\nKind regards\n",

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\n\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\n\nThanks and Regards\n\nShalini\n\n[2025-02-25T05:34:01.922Z] Tanush Tambe (@22f3002248)\nTag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…\n\n[2025-02-25T05:52:51.182Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nIt is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\n\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\n\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\n\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\n\nThe problem is the lack of time.\n\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\n\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\n\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\n\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\n\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-25T10:38:35.694Z] Shashannk (@23f2003413)\nhi\n@carlton\n\nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\n\n[2025-02-25T10:58:33.712Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nYou will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.\n\nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.\n\nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!\n\nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-25T13:05:15.578Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\n3 questions:-\n\nwill the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\n\nwill the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\n\nwill the live solving video lecture be recorded?\n\n[2025-02-25T13:10:30.614Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\n23f1002382:\n\nwill the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\n\nThey will be available after the live session",

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\n\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\n\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n\nHow limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\n\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\nToday’s Mock",

You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-02-26T03:58:46.473Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\n\n\n[2025-02-26T04:02:53.908Z] Shashannk (@23f2003413)\nThank you! will check out the session today\n\n[2025-02-26T09:16:29.955Z] Shubham Atkal (@shubhamatkal)\nHello\n@carlton\nsir , for me given constituency was\n\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"\n\nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency\n\ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\n\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957\n\nusing above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR\n\ndrive.google.com\n\ndf_gobindpur.csv\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nthen i used margin formula as\n\nmargin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\n\nusing this i got answer for 1st question as\n\nYEAR                              1992\nAC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\nWINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH\nWINNER_PARTY                       CPI\nWINNER_VOTES                    5000.0\nRUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH\nRUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC\nRUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0\nMARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114\n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\n\npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks\n\n[2025-02-26T11:23:42.616Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)\nshubhamatkal:\n\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\n\nshubham",

I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie?

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.\n\nAs you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge.

However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) .

The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\nKey Challenges Faced\n\nLack of Prerequisites\n\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students—including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\n\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores—we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n\n[2025-02-25T17:23:19.102Z] Mahi (@mahi.13)\nYes sir please look into this\n\n[2025-02-25T17:25:59.673Z] Sarthak Gupta  (@22f1000376)\n@Anand\n\n@Bharathi\nYes ma’am please pay attention to our concern.\n\n[2025-02-25T17:27:50.727Z] SAKSHI PATHAK (@Sakshi6479)\nYes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course.

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\nHere’s students’ feedback:\n\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n\n#\n\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\n\nTo learn well,",

The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\n\n[2025-02-25T21:19:52.440Z] Suhani Dubey (@23f1002698)\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\n\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this",

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\n\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\n\n[2025-02-26T09:28:00.959Z] Rishit (@Rrishit)\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students.\n\nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term.

It is written in the\nTools in Data Science\nthat we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI\ngh\nwhich we have to install in the vercel instance using\napt\npackage manager.\n\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\n\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\n\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install\nngrok\npackage.\n\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires\ndocker\npackage installed.\n\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\n\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\n\nAnd many more\n\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\n\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\n\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\n\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\n\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\n\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\n\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.\n\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\n\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or",

For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\n\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from\nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev\nwill be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\n\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.\n\n[2025-03-06T07:24:07.488Z] Kabir Vyas (@Kabir1203)\nCan you provide with an evaluation file like we had for Project 1.\n\n[2025-03-06T08:58:10.417Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\nCan we have groups for this please?\n@Jivraj\n\n@carlton\n\n@s.anand\n\n[2025-03-06T09:27:20.661Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)\nIf you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.\n\n[2025-03-06T09:32:07.810Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)\nWell if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that’s sufficient validation.\n\n[2025-03-06T09:38:01.726Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)\nIf you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,\n\nYes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project.

It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.\n\nThe first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\n\nCan you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\n\nHow do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\n\nThanks and Regards\n\nShalini\n\n[2025-03-07T04:49:57.688Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\nWhat does it mean to solve the question?\n\nEveryone is asking that?\n\nDo you yourself know what to do and to go about it?\n\nOr just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?\n\n“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”\n\nFrom my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that\n\n\" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field:\nanswer\nthat can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\"\n\nIf you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.\n\nLast project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.\n\nI understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project.

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\n\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.\n\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\n\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.\n\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\n\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\n\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\n\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\n\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\n\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\n\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\n\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\n\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\n\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\n\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\n\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\n\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type\ncode -s\n, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\n\nWhat is the output of\ncode -s\n? The output of\ncode -s\ncannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\n\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\n\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\n\nNote: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\n\nVercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\n\nIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\n\nClarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\n\nDeployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)\n\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\n\nPlatform Capability for GA Tasks\n\nWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\n\nNote: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\n\nFile Upload Example via Platform API\n\nRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\n\nThis would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\n\nGeneral Observations on GA1-5\n\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\n\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.\n\n[2025-03-26T07:18:55.105Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)\nThanks a lot\n@23f2005702\n, we’ll try to answer these questions in Thursday’s session.\n\n[2025-03-26T07:37:59.662Z] Tushar Jalan  (@23f2003751)\nIs their any way to solve this issue.\n@Jivraj\n\n[2025-03-26T10:42:30.198Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\n@carlton\n(\n@Saransh_Saini\n)\n@Jivraj\n, is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequ",

If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.\n\nPlease review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.\n\nThe browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines.

The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\n\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.\n\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\n\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\n\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably.

Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point.

I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n\nOrganization & Structure:\n\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\n\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\n\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\n\nTime Constraints:\n\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\n\nSessions & Support:\n\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\n\nDeployment Variability:\n\nEach GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\n\nEffort Acknowledgment:\n\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\n\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\n\nEven for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.\n\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete\nall 57 questions\nsuccessfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\n\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\n\nThank you for the learning opportunity\n\n[2025-03-27T10:30:29.421Z] Pr",

While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\n\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n@carlton\n\nI watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.\n\nHow should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.\n\n@s.anand\n\n@carlton\n\n@Jivraj\n\nAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions.

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using\nvicky_server.py\n, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses.\nMy mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?\n\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching.

Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.

Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras?

I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)\n\nThe first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking?\n\nI am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nOur teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?\n\nWe have made\nseveral hours of videos\non Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nI already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\n\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n\n23f2002668:\n\nThey explained what should be your approach? How to make project?\n\nYes these were explained if you\n\neither took part in any live session or\n\nwatched the recorded video\n\n23f2002668:\n\nAnd here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?\n\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nIt is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.\n\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\n\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\n\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\n\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\n\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nEven they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\nSince this",

Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\nSince this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\n\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\n\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\n\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\n\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\n\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n\n23f2002668:\n\nThey don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\n\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\n\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nAre we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\n\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\n\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\n\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first",

Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\n\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nThey only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.\n\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up.\nHaving said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.\nJust ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\n\nNow is a good time to start.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\n\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nI want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\n\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\n\nLuckily for you,\nour first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n\n23f2002668:\n\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\n\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nIn project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months",

Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\n\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\n\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\n\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\n\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n\n23f2002668:\n\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\n\nThankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.\n\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither\nrespect\nnor\nkindness\nis evident in your post.\n\nBut thank you for your feedback.\n\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\n\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS team\n\n[2025-04-02T12:44:19.919Z] B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (@23f2000573)\nHi, I have a few things to say\n\nMy background :\n\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS.",

I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\n\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\n\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\n\nThe video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\n\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\n\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n\nWhy did I fail?\n\nLast Term\n\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\n\nThis term.\n\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.\n\nIn both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\n\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\n\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\n\nOn another topic\n\nWhat does this RoE evaluate?\nImplicit learning.\n\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\n\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\n\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\n\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing",

Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\n\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an\nimplicit\nway.\n\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\n\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\n\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\n\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\n\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\n\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\n\nThanks to\n@s.anand\n,\n@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\nand\n@Saransh_Saini\n\nJust two suggestions\n\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\n\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.\n\n[2025-04-02T14:21:36.079Z] Parthiv (@parthivn28)\ntrue but I wish they can inform how quickly they can evaluate for those using paid platforms / ngrok\n\n[2025-04-02T14:34:43.238Z] Harsh jayswal (@Harshjayswal-2003)\n@carlton\n\n@Jivraj\n\n@Saransh_Saini\n\nHello Carlton,\n\nWhen are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?\n\nI have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit.

Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.\n\nCould you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.\n\n[2025-04-04T06:15:47.759Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nWe are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\n[2025-04-04T06:17:36.098Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nThe alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.\n\n[2025-04-04T06:24:18.228Z] Aarush saxena  (@23f2005702)\nin spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response??

But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.\n\nThen I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a\nstatic JSON structure\n? That quickly broke when users passed\ndifferent parameters, different files\n, or queried in\nnon-standard formats\nlike “code -s” or “code -v”.\n\nThe next idea: write\nindividual Python scripts per question\nfrom our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.\n\nThe Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\n\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n\nCentralized engine in\nvicky_server.py\n\nUses\nregex-based pattern matching\nto detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\n\nEach solution is a structured Python function like\nga1_first_solution(query=None)\n\nSupports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\n\nActs like a\nmini compiler for data science tools\n\nPresenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS\n\nVicky is a\nsmart, modular chatbot\nbuilt specifically for\nTool for Data Science at IIT",

During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to\n@Saransh_Saini\n.\n\nIt seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.\n\nWe just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\n\nWe hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.\n\nThank you\n\nLakshay\n\n[2025-04-04T08:04:29.014Z] Yashvardhan (@23f2004644)\nDear\n@carlton\n\n@s.anand\nSir\n\n“I’ve deployed my project to Microsoft Azure through GitHub, and my Azure for Students account was verified today.

If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.\n\nThis is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job.

However, I have not received any such communication on my end.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80.

This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well.

The API becomes accessible when using\npublic DNS services\nlike\nGoogle (8.8.8.8)\nor\nCloudflare (1.1.1.1)\n. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).\n\nSuggested Fix:\n\nTo ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a\npublic DNS\nprovider?\n\nRecommended options:\n\nGoogle DNS\n:\n8.8.8.8\n,\n8.8.4.4\n\nCloudflare DNS\n:\n1.1.1.1\n,\n1.0.0.1\n\nThis can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.\n\nAlternate Option:\n\nIf the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the\npreviously deployed endpoint\ninstead:\n\nhttps://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/\n\nPlease note that this endpoint may take\n50 to 60 seconds\nto respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.\n\nBoth endpoints are currently active and return identical results.\n\nThank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!\n\nBest regards,\n\nSahil Raj\n\n[2025-04-16T15:49:14.408Z] Kartikay Taunk (@kartikay1)\nWill it be possible for the evaluation of vercel link as well i have veen marked absent due to the email issues prevailing please look into this matter\n\n[2025-04-16T15:51:49.872Z] Reva Lakshmy Paul (@22f3000585)\nSir, my endpoint is deployed on render too.

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.\n\nAt that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.\n\nI checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.\n\nAdditionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.\n\nThank you!\n\n1000063856\n1920×858 139 KB\n\n[2025-04-16T17:57:02.894Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)\nHow long you want us to keep timeout of request is, right now we have 60 seconds of timeout.\n\n[2025-04-16T18:04:19.307Z] Gaurav Ghodge (@GaURaVinDeX)\n@carlton\n\n@Jivraj\n\nI have received 5 “200 OK” POST requests on my ngrok endpoint(which i had sent replying to\n@Jivraj\nemail before 10:30 PM) between 11:02 PM to 11:05 PM.\n\nDo i need to update my previous gform",

However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.\n\nIn such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?\n\nAdditionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.\n\n[2025-04-10T07:32:35.000Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nIf you are not provided access, contact the peer.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n\n1.

The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.\n(Thread link)\n\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n2. Project Updates\n\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\n3.

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1.

So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.\n\nIf students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.\n\nWe have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-03-29T04:49:26.499Z] Bhavin Biju (@Jack_sparrow1)\nimage\n633×197 4.25 KB\n\nThis is a screenshot of my docker log file.

Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.\n\nAlso just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.\n\nIf yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-03-29T05:08:33.580Z] Avnish Jajodia (@22f3001777)\n@carlton\n\nI encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:\n\n{\n\"detail\": \"'choices'\"\n}\n\nThis issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission.

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\n\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\n\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\n\nI at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\n\nBy this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.\n\nI understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\n\nI also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\n\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.\n\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written,",

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between\npandas\nand\nnumpy\ncaused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (\npandas==2.0.3\nand\nnumpy==1.24.3\n) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\n\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (\nsantoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\n). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation?

I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.\n\nFor Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK\n\nERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n\nSimilarly for task B2.\n\nINFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md\nERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n\nFor Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch.

When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.\n\nBut the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-03-31T21:05:40.325Z] SP (@22f3003083)\nI recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1.

This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.\n\nAdding useful API endpoints, including an\n/api/\nmultipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing\n/read\nand\n/run\nendpoints from Project 1, plus a\n/clear\nendpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.\n\nDeploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP\n, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.\n\nAll this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like\nhyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents\n, and it would do that for you—without\never\ndeclining the request. I like to think of it as a\nterminal version of\n\nOpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent\n.\n\nGiven all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project\nnaturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)\nand not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.\n\nTo clarify,\nall the updates",

The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.\n\nWe have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.\n\nWe hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-04-02T14:26:27.322Z] Vansh Mittal (@22f3001851)\n@carlton\n\n@Jivraj\n\nSir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.\n\nPlease sir see through it\n\n[2025-04-02T14:30:33.339Z] LAKSHAY (@lakshaygarg654)\nThanks\n@carlton\n, for your response.\n\nI was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.\n\nAlso, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?\n\n[2025-04-02T16:07:20.865Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nWe are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.\n\nThat way there is no architecture issues.\n\nIts part of our secondary check.

It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.\n\nWe discussed it internally with\n@s.anand\nand he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it\nregardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not\non the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.\n\nIn our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by\n@s.anand\n\nSo unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS team\n\n",

Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\n\nRegarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible\nwithin the scope of the problem statement\n.\n\nWhat began as just another (pun intended)\ntedious\nassignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.\n\n(…caution: long post ahead\n)\n\nI noticed that\ntest cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use\n. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the\ninherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads\n. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.\n\nSome might suggest using\ntemperature=0\nto get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\n\nHardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers\n: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.\n\nAt the core of it, it’s all about\nhow much flexibility vs rigidity\nwe give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\n\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\n\nReason about the task, understand intent,\n\nReflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e.\ndesign\na DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\n\nExecute those workflows (\nwalk\nthe DAG",

That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\n\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of\ngeneral-purpose tools\n:\n\nA REPL executor (for quick calcs)\n\nA Python script runner\n\nA Shell executor\n\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\n\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was\nemergent behavior\n, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research.\nFrankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!\n\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &\n@s.anand\nfor devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with.\nFood for thought! Really!\n\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.\n\nPS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects:\nthoughtful use of LLMs in agent design\n. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.\n\nKind regards\n\n[2025-04-05T07:12:52.908Z] Vansh Mittal (@22f3001851)\n@carlton\n\n@Jivraj\nSir please Consider this request!\n\n[2025-04-05T13:32:19.021Z] Srishty (@Srishty_Snehi)\nHello Sir,\n\nScreenshot_2025-04-05-18-51-43-721_com.google.android.g",

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\n\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\n\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\n\nAction Taken\n\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\n\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\n\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\n\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\n\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\n\nRequest for Re-Evaluation\n\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\n\nPrevious Message for Reference\n\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\n\"Greetings, Sir,\n\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\n\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your",

We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.\n\nA minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.\n\nCritical failures prevents everything else from working\nand thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.\n\nI know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.\n\nKindest regards\n\n[2025-04-07T05:54:42.672Z] Telvin Varghese (@22f2001640)\nHi\n@carlton\n,\n\nI couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites.

I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\n\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\n\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\n\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.\n\nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding.\n\n[2025-04-07T09:55:15.954Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)\nIssues with your submission has been resolved.\n\nThanks for raising the issue and checking it at your end.\n\n[2025-04-07T09:57:43.886Z]  KARTHIK (@24ds1000119)\nSir",

I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the\n\n/app/app/main.py\nfile is missing. However, in my project directory, the\n\nmain.py\nfile is located in the\napp/\nfolder, and the\nrun.py\nfile is in the root folder of the project, which is\nLLM_Automation_Agent\n. This structure allows the\nrun.py\nfile to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from\napp/main.py\n.\n\nTo run the project, the command I used is:\n\npython run.py\n\nSince\nrun.py\nis placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to\napp/main.py\n.\n\nI believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the\nrun.py\nscript located in the root folder (\nllm-automation-agent\n).\n\nFor your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.\n\nHere is the GitHub link to my project:\n\ngithub.com\n\nGitHub - ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent\n\nContribute to ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\nimage\n1440×2823 252 KB\n\nLookig forward towards your support.\n\nWith Regards\n\nK Senthur Kumaran\n\n[2025-04-07T14:53:21.728Z] Reva Lakshmy Paul (@22f3000585)\nSame here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.\n\nThe LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project.

Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nEven if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.\n\nimage\n1027×510 11 KB\n\nThough an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task.

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\n\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\n\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\n\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\n\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\n\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\n\nKindest regards\n\n[2025-04-02T15:20:45.985Z] Reva Lakshmy Paul (@22f3000585)\nSir,\n\nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.\n\nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).\n\nI completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.\n\nI completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.\n\nThankyou!\n\n[2025-04-02T15:55:00.653Z]",

I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.\n\nHowever, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.\n\nAddressing the queries you raised in your post:\n\nWhat is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?\n\nIn previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.\n\nWhat is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?\n\nI am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.\n\nDid anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?\n\nI have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:\n\nDear Learner,\n\nDEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm\n\nGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.\n\nPlease find the form link below to submit your evaluations.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9\n\nAFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,\n\nif you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.\n\nYou will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.\n\nYou have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.\n\nDoes anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?\n\nFrom the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.\n\nHas anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?\n\nMy peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.\n\nAfter answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.\n\n…\n\nGiven this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7.

However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\n\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\n\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.\n\nFinally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\n\nI’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.\n\nThank you once again for your understanding.\n\n[2025-04-09T19:47:16.765Z] Pranaav (@23f1002223)\nHello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time.\n\nI was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it.\n\n[2025-04-10T07:54:03.032Z] Muhammed Adhil Pt (@22f3002034)\nI agree with all my peers.

Here is the main query that most people are having:\n\n23f2004636:\n\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.\n\nHere is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:\n\nEvery term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.\n\nThe course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.\n\n192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this\n\nAs a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).\n\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?\n\nIt is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.",

You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort\nbefore\nthere was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.\n\nOnce again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.\n\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.\n\nI had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA.

I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.\n\nHowever, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so\nnot\nfor extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.\n\nNow that bonus marks are announced\nafter\nthe deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.\n\nI’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.\n\n[2025-04-11T13:30:26.411Z] Karthik V (@23f1001174)\nSir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.\n\nIf the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.\n\nThe main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior.

This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.\n\nGiven that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these\n\n[2025-04-11T14:33:49.220Z] Akshit Mittal (@23f2004636)\nThank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised.\n\njkmadathil:\n\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?\n\nWith due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:\n\n“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”\n\nAs mentioned above, my intention was never to express\njealousy\n. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.\n\njkmadathil:\n\nYou have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.\n\nI would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6.\nPersonally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience\n, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.\n\nFurther, you mentioned:\n\njkmadathil:\n\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.\n\nI completely respect the effort put in by those students.\n\nHowever, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.\n\nIf the bonus is truly a recognition of effort\nspecific to GA7\n, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the\nGA7 score\nonly, not in the\noverall course total\n, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.\n\nI know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.\n\nThank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.\n\n[2025-04-12T12:39:08.444Z] Pranaav (@23f1002223)\nThank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue.\n\nIt is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from",

So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.\n\nAnother issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.\n\nOnce again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.\n\nThank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.\n\n[2025-04-13T14:35:01.742Z] Karthik V (@23f1001174)\n@jkmadathil\n\n@carlton\n\n@s.anand\n\n@Jivraj\n\nSir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.\n\nShouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.\n\nHow can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.\n\nJust because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments",

Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\n\nFirstly students\nvastly\noverestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\n\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.\n\nOnly 2 students managed it.\n\nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6\nmight\nhave even managed to get 3 or more marks.\n\nSo lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.\nThe mean bonus score was 1.27.\n\nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\n\nThat is the data for you.\n\nStudent Bonus\n600×371 7.62 KB\n\nAlso noteworthy\n\nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.\n\nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know",

Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?\n\nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are\nnot\nwidely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!\n\nBonuses are not a right.\nThey are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\n\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:\n\nOpportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.\n\n[2025-04-14T15:36:28.606Z] Yogesh (@Yogesh1)\n@carlton\n\nCould you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given?\n\n[2025-04-14T15:40:25.687Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)\nThe rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.\n\n[2025-04-14T15:57:42.348Z] Shambhavi  (@24f2003130)\nHi\n@carlton\nsir and\n@Jivraj\nsir,\n\nSir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded.

Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.\n\nGiven these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted\n\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.\n\n[2025-04-14T16:05:33.925Z] Yogesh (@Yogesh1)\nI am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don’t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.\n\nI hope the data is not being skewed because of the  total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.\n\n[2025-04-18T14:09:27.152Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)\nSIGMA ADMIN\n\n[2025-04-19T08:58:39.763Z] Aindree Chatterjee (@23f2000983)\nThank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The  course’s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong\n",
